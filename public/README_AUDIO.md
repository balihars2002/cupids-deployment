# Audio File Setup

To add background music:

1. Add your song file (MP3 format) to this `public` folder
2. Name it `your-song.mp3`
3. The app will automatically play it on first user interaction

Note: Browsers block auto-play, so the audio will only play after the user clicks or touches the screen.
